# 🌟 Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing 📊

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis** project! This repository provides a full guide to building and training a machine learning model for classifying text sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing sentiment in text data, covering:

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹
2. **Feature Extraction** 🔠
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** 🚀
4. **Data Visualization** 📈

Each stage is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` for a clear, reproducible workflow.

## 🛠 Techniques Used

### 1. Data Preprocessing 🧹

Preprocessing prepares raw text data for machine learning models by cleaning and standardizing it. Techniques include:

- **Tokenization** ✂️: Splits text into individual words or tokens, which are easier for the model to process.
- **Lowercasing** 🔡: Converts all characters to lowercase to ensure consistency.
- **Stopwords Removal** 🛑: Removes common words (e.g., "is," "the") that add little meaning in sentiment analysis.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization** 🌱: Reduces words to their root forms, such as turning "running" into "run," for consistency across word forms.

These steps ensure that the text data is clean and consistent, which is critical for achieving good model performance.

### 2. Feature Extraction 🔠

After preprocessing, we use **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to transform text data into a numerical format suitable for modeling.

- **TF (Term Frequency)** 📏: Measures the frequency of a word in a document.
- **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)** 🌍: Weights words that are unique across documents higher than common words.

The result is a TF-IDF score for each word, which allows the model to treat text as structured data.

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation 🚀

The processed data is used to train a variety of machine learning models, each with unique strengths:

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)** 🎲: A probabilistic model particularly effective for text classification tasks, especially when working with TF-IDF features.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** 🔄: A neural network architecture designed for sequence data. RNNs consider the order of words in a sentence, making them well-suited for sentiment analysis.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** 🔁: An advanced RNN variant with memory cells that retain important information over long sequences, addressing the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. LSTMs are widely used for tasks that require understanding context in sequential data.
- **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** ⚙️: Similar to LSTM but with a simplified architecture, GRUs are computationally efficient while still handling long-term dependencies, making them a good choice for large datasets or real-time applications.

Each model learns to classify sentiment based on patterns in the data, and we evaluate their performance to determine which model performs best.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics 📊

Model performance is assessed using various metrics to gain insights into strengths and areas for improvement:

- **Accuracy** 🎯: The overall percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision** 🎨: Indicates how many of the model's positive predictions were correct, reducing false positives.
- **Recall** 🔍: Measures how many actual positives were correctly predicted, which is important for capturing all relevant instances.
- **F1-Score** ⚖️: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

These metrics together provide a balanced view of model performance.

### 5. Data Visualization 📈

Visualizations enhance understanding of model results and data distributions:

- **Confusion Matrix** 🗂️: Visualizes the count of correct and incorrect predictions per class, helping to identify misclassification patterns.
- **Sentiment Distribution Histogram** 📊: Shows the balance of sentiment classes in the dataset.
- **Model Performance Plots** 📉: Graphs like accuracy and F1-Score trends provide insights into model improvement and stability.

These visuals help interpret the results and guide model tuning.
